# Social Media FastAPI
This project is a fully containerized and deployable RESTful Social Media API backend, designed with modern Python based technologies.
<br>
At its core the backend is built using Python's FastAPI with SQLModel for ORM and Pydantic for data validation. The asynchronous request handling is managed by Uvicorn, which runs under the process manager Gunicorn. The database layer uses PostgresSQL. An Nginx server acts as a reverse proxy forwarding client requests and enforcing IP-based rate limiting. Authentication has been implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), with tokens being issued on a successful login, and required in request headers for certain endpoints. To further increase account security, login throttling has been implemented using a Redis database to track failed login attempts. Furthermore to improve performance, caching has been added using the same Redis database, to temporarly store response data.
<br>
The FastAPI application, SQL database, Redis, and Nginx reverse proxy are each containerized separately and managed together using Docker and Docker Compose.
<br>
The API includes interactive documentation via FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI, and the development lifecycle is managed using GIT and GitHub for version control.
This application has been successfully deployed on a Raspberry Pi with Linux as operating system. The entire stack is configured to auto start as a service via systemd in the background.

## Project Structure
This API consist of four containerized components:
- Nginx Reverse Proxy:
    - Forwarding client requests
    - IP based rate limiting
- Python FastAPI Application:
    - Asynchronously handles incoming requests
    - Creates, Reads, Updates and Deletes data in the PostgresDB
    - Interacts with the Redis DB to implement caching and throttling
    - Handles authentication and password hashing
    - Sends HTTP responses
- Redis database:
    - Caches data for faster response times
    - Stores failed login attempts to implement throttling      
- Postgres SQL database:
    - Main relational database storing all the data
